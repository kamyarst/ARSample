# ARSample
This is a sample AR project written with Swift language for iOS devices. While I was learning the ARKit framework, I defined this project and this is the result.

It contains 4 sections:
1. Earth and Ship: At the center, there is the Earth, and a ship with an animation flies around the earth.
2. Paint: You can paint anything with any color in the real world!
3. Surface: A surface detection that can detect vertical and horizontal surfaces.
4. Measurement: It lets you measure the distance between two points in the real world.

Some Key features:
- [ ] Architecture: MVVM
- [X] Using SceneKit and ARKit
- [X] Swift 5
- [X] Without external libraries
